abstract: Thin-walled tubes are widely used as energy absorbers due to their
  high crashworthiness performance. This study aims to evaluate the effect of
  plastic forming history carried out for thickness optimization on
  crashworthiness performance of thin-walled square tube (TWST). Within the
  scope of the study, a series of numerical analyzes were conducted for the TWST
  using commercial finite element (FE) software. In order to determine the
  individual effect of optimization, the FG thickness of TWST was first obtained
  using LS-OPT software. Later, thickness gradient was achieved by performing a
  rolling process to consider individual plastic forming effects. Afterwards, a
  deep drawing process was carried out to shape TWST by considering springback
  and trimming effects. Finally, crash responses were obtained under axial
  high-velocity impact loading to determine the coupled effect of optimization
  and plastic forming on the crashworthiness performance of the TWST. It was
  determined that the coupled effect, which takes plastic forming and
  optimization effects into account, reduced the peak crush force of the TWST by
  24% and increased the absorbed energy value by 39%. The results obtained from
  this study showed that coupled effect of optimization and plastic forming
  processes has a significant effect on the crashworthiness performance of the
  TWST, and otherwise, either overestimated or underestimated results are
  obtained.

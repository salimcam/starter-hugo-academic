abstract: This study experimentally determines the tensile failure load of the
  nanocomposite adhesive – obtained by adding nanostructures to the adhesive –
  using four different methods in single-lap joints. For the study, adhesively
  bonded single-lap joints were produced by using DP460 liquid structural epoxy
  as the adhesive, AA2024-T3 aluminum alloy as the adherend and graphene as the
  nanostructure. When the failure load obtained from the experiments was
  examined, it was seen that, while the nanostructure-reinforced methods
  indicated in the literature have a great effect on the failure load of the
  joint and the standard deviation, a new method developed in this study
  increased the failure load of the joint and minimized the standard deviation.
  These improvements increased the reliability and reproducibility of the joint.

abstract: Development  in  material  science  imposes  to  use  different  materials
  in production. This causes a problem for joining different materials
  because  traditional  joining  techniques  such  as  welding  could  not  overcome  this  problem  in  industries  such  as  automotive.  Hence,  adhesive  bonding  overcomes  this  problem  by  its  superiorities  to  join  different  materials.  The  joint  strength  of  epoxy-based  adhesives  is  affected  by  adhesive  thickness,  adherent’s
  surface quality, and curing conditions. In this study, two different
  materials  (SAE  304  and  AL7075)  were  bonded  by  epoxy  adhesive  (3M  DP460NS)
  as single lap joint (SLJ) of Aluminum-Aluminum, Steel-Steel, and
  Aluminum-Steel. The effects of adhesive thickness (0.05, 0.13, 0.25 mm) and
  surface roughness (281, 193, 81 nm) to strength were compared. SLJs were
  tested for 1, 10, 25 and 50 mm/min
  displacement  rates.  Adhesive  surface  structures   were   imaged   by   Scanning   Electron   Microscopy   (SEM)   to   investigate  adhesive  fractures.  Surface  roughnesses  were  examined  by  using  Atomic  Force  Microscopy  (AFM)  to  compare  its  influence  on  failure  load.  Finite
  Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted by using Cohesive Zone Model with ANSYS
  18.0 software to obtain stress distribution of
  adhesive.  Optimum  values  according  to  the  present  conditions  of  the  thickness  (0.13mm)  and  roughness  (<200nm)  were  determined.  Experimental  results  were
  demonstrated that while displacement rates rose, failure loads increased as
  well. FEA analysis was fit to experimental results. It has been observed that
  along with material type, peel stresses become an important factor for joint
  strength.
